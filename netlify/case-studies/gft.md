      Stoplight allows even the most non-technical team members to take a shot
      at defining an API using Stoplight’s visual editor — it reduces the
      learning curve to a minimum, people get to grips with the basics of API
      specification development in a matter of hours — not weeks. Also, it makes
      documenting an API and providing a testing harness for it a breeze.

## GFT's Grievance

GFT Technology was looking for an API Design tool that promoted and allowed for collaboration between technical and non-technical staff. The non-technical staff was struggling with having to create models with the OpenAPI Specification and the learning curve was very steep. They not only needed a tool that promoted collaboration but also increased efficiency, catered to multiple personas, and met the needs of the developers (e.g. code editor, markup, testing, etc.) and the needs of non-technical staff (e.g. visual tools, data models, documentation, etc.).

## The Stoplight Strategy

Stoplight’s platform provided GFT with a balanced platform that provided developers with a developer experience (Code and Design View) and non-technical staff a UX (Read and Design View). The different personas could collaborate seamlessly with a single source of truth for their API Development which, in turn, increased “confidence, speed, and efficiency” in API Development. Their learning curve was dramatically reduced, and they saved valuable time by documenting and testing with Stoplight.
