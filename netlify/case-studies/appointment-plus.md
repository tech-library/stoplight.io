      We really enjoy the modeling feature, helping us define our API before
      even writing code. Also, the way the modeling feature inherits models from
      other Projects. Documentation integrates with OAS files, both partials or
      the entire schema, which is rad.

## Appointment Plus’ Aggravation

AppointmentPlus was managing multiple APIs built by different teams, at different times, with different strategies and intents. Some of their APIs were documented as PDFs, not documented at all, or were documented using a custom solution.

They were also experiencing issues managing their service’s schemas and their testing solution was written and maintained by their development team.

## The Stoplight Strategy

Since AppointmentPlus started using Stoplight, they have been able to dump their API Documentation system and are getting close to being able to replace the PDF documentation. The Modeling tool helps them create schemas for approval before coding them within one central location. And Scenarios has allowed them to free up development resources by providing outside users the ability to write test cases. Design-first approach.
