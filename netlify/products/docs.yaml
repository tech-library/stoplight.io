      Stoplight offers multiple ways for your API consumers to try out your API.
      Test Requests within your documentation allows consumers to understand how
      your API works. Code Examples generated from dozens of languages such as
      JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, cURL, and more allow consumers to copy and
      paste right into their own code.
