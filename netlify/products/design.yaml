    Start designing your API in minutes. Use the OpenAPI Specification (formerly
    known as Swagger) with Stoplight’s visual editor to design consistent and
    standardized REST APIs for your organization. Without writing any code,
    model complex APIs faster than ever while simultaneously getting feedback on
    your prototypes with hosted mock servers.

      Get started quickly with API design-first principles. Import an existing
      API or start from scratch with a new API, zero coding required. The Visual
      Editor reduces time to get started on your API design by providing an
      intuitive UI.

      Design an API with speed and efficiency from scratch. Stoplight’s Visual
      Editor decreases the learning curve so you don’t need to be an OpenAPI
      expert to create first-class API designs. Describe endpoints, headers,
      bodies, multiple responses, query string parameters, shared models, and
      much more.

      Instantly prototype and collaborate on your API design with our
      integrated, hosted Mock Servers, powered by Prism. Mock a single API,
      multiple APIs, or even just a few endpoints. Increase efficiency by
      allowing your fronted teams to start implementation while the backend team
      develops the API.
