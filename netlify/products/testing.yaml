  Increase the test coverage of your web APIs so they break less for your
  consumers online. Create a full collection of tests with Stoplight Testing.
  Use Environment and Context Variables to reference other complex test
  scenarios to accelerate test generations and reduce duplication. Whether you
  are writing test for just one API call or a scenario of API calls working
  together in a real-life use case, Stoplight Testing gives you the flexibility
  to make your tests fit you workflow by supporting command line and CI/CD
  pipeline integrations. Contract Testing your API against your OpenAPI
  Specification (formerly known as Swagger) or JSON Schema is possible with our
  simple visual Test Editor.

    description: >-
      With our Visual Test Editor, create multi-step test scenarios to automate
      testing your web(REST) APIs. Build scenarios by capturing and passing data
      between test API calls. Then integrate your test scenarios into your
      existing CI/CD pipeline with our command line tool, powered by Prism.

    title: Contract Testing
    description: >-
      Create test collections that ensure the API implementation meets the
      standards and definitions described in your OpenAPI Specification or JSON
      Schema, also known as Contract Testing. Stoplight uses realistic, dynamic
      data based on your OpenAPI Specification to simulate real-life API
      consumers across your local development, staging, and production
      environments complementing your Unit tests.

    description: >-
      With integrated Contract Testing reporting capabilities, you can track
      your progress towards 100% coverage. Stoplight verifies that the API
      responses for different status codes match the contract of a connected
      OpenAPI Specification; enabling collaboration over API test coverage
      within your organization.
