    title: Instant Mock Server
    description: >-
      Supercharge any OpenAPI Specification with Stoplight Mocking. Once you
      have created or imported your OpenAPI Specification, you have access to an
      instant mock server, which automatically reloads when your specification
      changes. A mock API simulates the behavior of a real API allowing
      collaboration and feedback on your API design.

    description: >-
      With Mocking, you can accelerate the development of new APIs. Teams can
      work in tandem before the API is available through virtualization.
      Stoplight’s mock servers can virtualize internal and external APIs within
      your platform with dynamic responses generated from your JSON Schema,
      which can be run locally or hosted with Stoplight.

    title: Automatic Request Validation
    description: >-
      Validates requests and responses against your OpenAPI Specification.
      Simulates real server behavior by automatically validating incoming
      request headers, query strings, and request bodies against your OpenAPI
      Specification.

    title: Customizable
    description: >-
      Need a mocked response property to always be a random future date? No
      problem. Mocking can extend your OpenAPI Specification with scripts before
      or after traffic reaches your mock server. Write scripts for more complex
      mocking behavior, custom validations, and much more.
